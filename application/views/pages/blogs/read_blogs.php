	 How many things do we think in a day? How many feelings do we go through? Feelings that belong to so many categories as happiness, sadness, regret, guilt, 
	 jealousy, inferiority, pride, love. I have always lingered around the question. What are feelings? How can some things make us 'happy' and others 'sad' ? 
	 I have also noticed, that we love sticking to the feelings that make us sad, but all of us want to be happy. That, I have realized over the past few months, 
	 is just not possible.<br><br>
	 Not everything in the world can be perfect from our point of view. Neither can things always remain as they are. Life is full of surprises, good and bad.
	 We would never appreciate the happiness if it always stayed as we wanted it to. The reasons to live and smile in this world are too many to be sad about 
	 anything. Let us appreciate the fact that what is not there was not the best for us. Let us have faith in the miracles waiting to happen, because they do!
	 And when life surprises you with what it has in store for you, you will thank God for not letting you settle for anything less.
	 We, as human beings, were born with limited intellect and understanding of how nature governs us. That is the prime reason for sadness. We need to believe 
	 that everything that is happening is with the consent of a power that loves us unconditionally. We need to look into our own past, everyone has at least 
	 once thanked God for not fulfilling his/her wish. Let us have faith and patience, because magic lies in the eyes of the spectator. Let us live every day, 
	 because the future that might not exist is not worth worrying about! Let us surrender, because those who surrender are those who rise!<br><br>
	 A person's talent is the dearest possession of him. And the things and people we dedicate it to are definitely very special in our life. So I don't think 
	 it's bad to lose inspiration on losing something special. It's just a little sad never finding it again. It's never too late looking for things and people 
	 that drive you to be your best.
